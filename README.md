# Udacity Bikeshare Project

This is the second project for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program where bike ride-share data for a few select cities (New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary statistics for each city.

 The project and implementation is done using Python 3.
